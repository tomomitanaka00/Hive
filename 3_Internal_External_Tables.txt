create table if not exists table7 (col1 string, col2 array<string>, col3 string, col4 int) row format delimited fields terminated by ',' collection items terminated by ':' lines terminated by ‘\n’ stored as textfile;

-- external table
create external table if not exists table12 (col1 string, col2 array<string>, col3 string, col4 int) row format delimited fields terminated by ',' collection items terminated by ':' lines terminated by ‘\n’ stored as textfile;
load data local inpath'home/tomomit/files/table1' into table table12;
select * from table12;
drop table table12;
select * from table12;
-- only metadata is lost, but the actual data in the HDFS location is present. Because table12 is an external table.
